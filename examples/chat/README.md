## Flux Chat Example

This is an example application we've created to show an example of how a Flux
app is structured, and how you might use waitFor to make sure the Stores'
registered callbacks are called in the correct order.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm run build`

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.
